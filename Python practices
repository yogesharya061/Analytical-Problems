Question:1
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Solution:
l=[]
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))

print ','.join(l)

Question:2
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
def fact(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    return x * fact(x - 1)

x=int(raw_input())
print fact(x)


Question:3

By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th,6th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].

Hints:
Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
Use enumerate() to get (index, value) tuple.

Solution:

li = [12,24,35,70,88,120,155]
li = [x for (i,x) in enumerate(li) if i%2!=0]
print li


Question:4

Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.

Hints:
Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class.

Solution:

class Person(object):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Unknown"

class Male( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Male"

class Female( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Female"

aMale = Male()
aFemale= Female()
print aMale.getGender()
print aFemale.getGender()
